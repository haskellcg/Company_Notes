# Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Problem and Applicability Statement

## Abstract
  Current IEEE 802.1 LANs use spanning tree protocols that have a number of chanllenges. These protocols need to strickly avoid loops. even temporary ones, during route propagation, because of the lack of header loop detection support. Routing tend not to take full advantage of alternate paths, or even non-overlapping pairwise paths (in the case of spanning trees).
